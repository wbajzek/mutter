mutter is sort of a personal twitter. with a corny name. 

In playing around with various note-taking applications, I felt like the ones I tried were buggy and prone to feature bloat.

* runs on my own server
* has a Mac Dashboard widget for conveniently adding notes
* has tags (with auto-suggest) and search
* has todos (tag a note #todo and it magically has a checkbox)

This all pretty much works already, although the dashboard widget does not yet have auto-suggest. The code is there but it needs to be styled in a way that works in the widget. The next step would be a iPhone/iPad interfaces.

It uses Camping, JQuery, and Dashcode (optional). For now, it uses ActiveRecord. 

Sorry, but you're not limited to 140 characters.
